Name: Luciano Grullon  

Overview: This is a basic website for a small advisory consulting firm that services businesses in Latin America, primarily Chile, with Financial and Accounting specific matters.  

Details on how to use: Home is a simple high level description of what we're about. Services tab provides more detailed information per category (Financial and Accounting). The team tab provides some background on our individual credentials. The contact tab allows for individuals to submit inquiries to us via email.  

Technologies used: HTML, CSS  

Ideas for future improvement:  
(1) Perhaps use a better font for the main body text throughout the site.  
(2) Perhaps consider paying for stock photos of Chile and LatAm.   
(3) Would love to include a log-in section for current clients to manage their respective engagements and save engagement-related documents there.
